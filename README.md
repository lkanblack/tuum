## Questions ðŸ¤”

#### Explanation of important choices for implementation and technologies in your solution

Material-UI offers a wide variety of ready-made components that in my opinion look very good for this form and add simplicity to the development and and effect to users.

#### Analysis on what impacts your bundle size the most and what youâ€™ve done to optimise it

Large Bundle.js file in Netwrok monitor. To fix that, used lazy loading for components and added loading bar to make user undersandable what is going on page.
